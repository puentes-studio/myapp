FullStack Developer, My experience lies in creating user experiences using Vite-React, taking advantage of its efficiency to implement responsive designs or perfecting user interfaces. Motivated by ambitious goals, a keen eye for detail and a penchant for innovation. I can trans- late concepts into captivating digital experiences. I am excited to continue improving myself in the ever-evolving landscape of frontend development. My skill set encompasses Agile Methodologies, Mobile-First Development, Version Control, UI/UX Design, Responsive Design, and Performance Optimization.
With several years of experience as a graphic designer and video editor, I stand out for my teamwork and attention to detail in multiple projects. Able to work independently from remote locations or in office environments as required by the company, with a goal-oriented and problem-solving perspective.
